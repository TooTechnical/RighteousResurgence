## UX (User Experience)

The user experience is designed to be intuitive and engaging. The website features a clean layout, easy-to-read typography, and a humorous approach. Users can easily navigate between pages using the navigation bar, and the content is structured to provide a logical flow of information.



## User Stories

- As a user, I want to vote for who I think will win the 2024 Presidential Election so that I can see where I stand among fellow Americans.
- As a user, I want to take a fun quiz to test my knowledge about the presidential candidates.
- As a user, I want to participate in discussions about the 2024 Presidential Election.

## Strategy

The goal of this project is to create an informative and engaging website about the 2024 Presidential Election. The website should appeal to users who are interested in politics and enjoy humor. The primary call-to-action is for users to vote for their preferred candidate, with a secondary call-to-action to take quizzes and participate in discussions which will be featured in a later update due to the complexity of databases and of course, issues with Node.js and MongoDB which I did try to incorporate into the website but went down a rabbit hole, but for future updates I will incorporate the community features and will create login forms and servers where a community can engage with other members.


## Scope
The scope of this project includes:

- Designing and developing a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Creating a clean and humorous layout with easy-to-read typography
- Allowing users to vote (for Fun not real-time polls), take quizzes, and participate in discussions I will release the community feature at a later date


### Structure
The website has a simple structure for ease of navigation:
- Header: Contains navigation links.
- Main: Features sections for content including voting, quizzes, and discussions.
- Footer: Includes social media links and contact information. Regarding social  media, the links to the social media are there but I have not yet got around to making the social media profiles.
