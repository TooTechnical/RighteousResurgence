## Brief Introduction

This is a comprehensive guide to the Righteous Resurgence website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes three main pages: Home, Presidents Test, and Quiz. The Home page introduces the main features of the website, the President's Test page includes a humorous quiz about presidential fitness, and the Quiz page tests users' knowledge about the 2024 presidential election.

## ü•¥ Welcome to RIGHTEOUS RESURGENCE

This, dear examiner, is a *comprehensive* (ish) guide to the Righteous Resurgence website ‚Äì built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more caffeine than is medically advised.  

It includes three core pages:
- **Home** ‚Äì where the journey begins.
- **Presidents Test** ‚Äì a quiz full of satire and presidential nonsense.
- **Quiz Page** ‚Äì where you‚Äôll be grilled about the 2024 US presidential election like it‚Äôs the Leaving Cert but with more memes.

It‚Äôs basic. I know.  
**Design-wise it looks like a toaster built a website.**  
But I‚Äôm stressed out of me mind, haven‚Äôt slept since Project 3, and my **eyeballs feel like tiny dry Weetabix** from staring at the screen 24/7.

## üî• Major Update: Django + PostgreSQL Full-Stack Madness & Heroku Deployment

Because I *clearly hate myself*, I decided to upgrade the whole thing to a full-stack Django web app using Python, PostgreSQL, and Heroku.

Here‚Äôs what I did ‚Äì or attempted to do ‚Äì without going completely insane:

---

### ‚úÖ What I Did (While Clinging to Sanity)
- Converted the static site into a full Django 5.2 project.
- Set up **PostgreSQL** using Heroku‚Äôs hobby-dev add-on because I love pain.
- Configured environment variables with `python-decouple` to hide sensitive info like it's state secrets.
- Added **WhiteNoise** because static files were acting like rebellious teenagers.
- Deployed to Heroku with **actual success** (after crying, shouting, praying, and briefly speaking to the modem like it was my therapist).
- Added **CKEditor** so the admin panel could edit articles without needing an exorcism.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced (Also Known As Emotional Damage)

#### üß± Environment Setup Errors
**Problem:** DATABASES wasn‚Äôt defined in `settings.py`  
**Fix:** Defined the DATABASES dictionary like a good boy, **after hours of Googling and inner screaming.**

#### üí• Deployment Issues on Heroku
**Problem:** `collectstatic` failed like a drunk fella at 2am trying to stand still.  
**Fix:** Set a proper `DATABASE_URL`, fixed the config vars, sacrificed a Mars bar to the Git gods.

#### üì¶ Procfile Not Detected
**Problem:** Heroku looked at my Procfile and said, ‚ÄúNah.‚Äù  
**Fix:** Fixed the syntax (`web: gunicorn righteousresurgence.wsgi`) and **actually committed the damn file to Git**, unlike the 14 times I forgot.

#### üßº Static Files‚Ä¶ Again
**Problem:** Static files were refusing to load. Just blank. Like me brain.  
**Fix:** Installed **WhiteNoise**, set `STATICFILES_STORAGE` to `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage` and prayed to Saint Stack Overflow.

#### üìù Admin Panel Woes
**Problem:** The admin panel looked like a 2005 Nokia menu. No rich text.  
**Fix:** Installed `django-ckeditor`, updated models to use `RichTextField()`, and boom ‚Äì content creation, but make it glamorous.

## üò© Final Reflections From a Broken Man

They said **‚ÄúPython is easy to learn.‚Äù**  
I want names.  
Because **whoever said that has never met Django at 2am on a deadline.**

They said **‚ÄúOnce you understand Django's concept, you're grand.‚Äù**  
Right.  
Well after **1,000+ repositories, 73 nervous breakdowns**, and enough trial and error to qualify as an Olympic sport,  
I *think* I finally understand it.  
**But I‚Äôve definitely lost at least two marbles and one sense of reality.**

So yes ‚Äì it looks basic.  
It‚Äôs not shiny or sexy.  
But it works. It lives. It breathes. And it‚Äôs mine.  

I did it while stressed, under-caffeinated, over-coding, and **with the emotional stability of a wet tissue in a wind tunnel.**

Enjoy the quiz.  
Mind yourself.  
And for the love of God‚Ä¶ **send Guinness.**

## ü§Ø UX (User Experience)

Right. So let‚Äôs be honest here ‚Äì this isn‚Äôt just a website. It‚Äôs a **comedy experiment wrapped in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the blood, sweat, and emotional breakdowns of a man who‚Äôs been staring at VS Code since Tuesday**.

The user experience is designed to be *intuitive*, *engaging*, and just the right amount of **‚Äúwhat the hell am I looking at?‚Äù**

- Clean layout (well, mostly).
- Easy-to-read text.
- A whole lotta humour.

Navigation is straightforward. Click a link. End up in a quiz. Or a news article. Or a political fever dream. It‚Äôs like *Black Mirror*, but with buttons that actually work (sometimes).

---

## ü§ì User Stories (or at least, attempts at humanity)

- *As a user*, I want to vote for who I think will win the 2024 Presidential Election, so I can feel like I participated in democracy‚Ä¶ sort of.
- *As a user*, I want to take a quiz to test my knowledge and my sanity.
- *As a user*, I want to join a community of absolute **lunatics who take the piss out of everything**, and I mean *everything* ‚Äì politics, celebrities, reality, even fonts.

---

## üîß Strategy (The Plan‚Ä¶ and the Panic)

The goal here was simple:  
**Make a website about the 2024 US Election that‚Äôs informative, hilarious, and doesn‚Äôt explode.**

Main Call-to-Action:  
üó≥Ô∏è *Vote for your preferred candidate!*  
Secondary:  
üß† *Take quizzes!*  
Tertiary (aka ‚ÄúComing Soon, I Swear‚Äù):  
üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë *Join the comedy community from hell!*

I *did* try to build it with Node.js and MongoDB originally.  
Honestly? I fell so deep down that rabbit hole, I started hearing voices in JavaScript.

So I pivoted.  
**Django. PostgreSQL. Sanity held together by Blu Tack.**

---

## üîô Backend Features You Can Actually Use!

Here‚Äôs the mad thing:  
**I added a full Django backend.**

Yep. You can **log in**.  
Admins can even **create articles** using a lovely little CKEditor interface.  
Wanna try it? Go ahead ‚Äì click **‚ÄúNews‚Äù** in the nav bar. You‚Äôll see a **sample article** in there:

> ‚ÄúWhat If Donald Trump Became President & Commander-in-Chief of Ireland?‚Äù  
> *It‚Äôd be great craic. Go read it. Try not to cry from laughter. That‚Äôs the point of this site.*

In a future update ‚Äì once I‚Äôve regained the will to code again ‚Äì users will be able to:
- **Sign up**
- **Join a community of comedians**
- **Post articles**
- **Take the mick out of absolutely everything**

Because this isn‚Äôt just satire.  
It‚Äôs a **digital therapy session disguised as a political website**.

---

## üìè Scope

This project includes:

- A responsive (ish) site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and PostgreSQL  
- A layout that‚Äôs clean and comedic (depending on your sense of humour and your blood sugar levels)  
- Voting (not legally binding ‚Äì just for the craic)  
- Quizzes that will either teach you something or make you question everything  
- A News section populated by admin-created satire articles  
- A Django backend, login feature, and editor functionality  
- And future plans for a **community of piss-takers and satire specialists**

---

## üß± Structure

Simple and sane (or as sane as I could manage):

- **Header**: Navigation links. Self-explanatory. No dropdowns. I‚Äôm not a wizard.
- **Main**: All the content ‚Äì voting, quizzes, articles, your existential dread.
- **Footer**: Placeholder links to social media.  
  And I mean placeholder ‚Äì I haven‚Äôt made the accounts yet.  
  Priorities, ya know?

---

## üé® Surface

**Typography**: Arial, sans-serif.  
Classic. Functional. Not going to win awards, but won‚Äôt make your eyes bleed either.

**Colours**:
- `#f4f4f4` ‚Äì calming, like a warm mug of beige.
- `#333` ‚Äì dark, serious. Adds contrast. Also hides the tears.
- `#fff` ‚Äì used for icons, buttons, and my hopes.

**Imagery**: There‚Äôs supposed to be a hero image.  
It exists‚Ä¶ somewhere. Possibly on a corrupted USB stick in a parallel universe.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Typography

Arial, sans-serif.  
Why?

Because it‚Äôs **clean, safe, and doesn‚Äôt ask too many questions**.  
I was gonna use Google Fonts, but then Django gave me a migraine, and I chose peace.

## Imagery

## üß† A Note on Imagery, JavaScript, and Me Own Sanity

Right, so ‚Äì let‚Äôs just get this out of the way: **there‚Äôs no imagery**.  
Not because I‚Äôm lazy (though fair play if you guessed that), but because this project was haunted. Genuinely. Cursed. Like **Banshee-code poltergeist** levels of chaos.

### The JavaScript?  
Wouldn‚Äôt behave.  
It kept breaking things like a drunk uncle at a communion.  

One minute it‚Äôs running grand, the next the **pie chart disappears**, the **footer decides it wants to live on top of everything like a dictator**, and HTML just stands there going,  
> ‚ÄúNot my problem, pal.‚Äù

---

## üé• The Video Situation

I tried to compensate for the visual tragedy by embedding a **video** ‚Äì y‚Äôknow, bring some life into it.  
Did it load?  
**Did it hell.**

At this point, I‚Äôve given up.  
Not forever ‚Äì just until I have **more time**, **more patience**, and **more Guinness** at home.  
Which I don‚Äôt.  
All I have is a **box of Lidl cornflakes** and a **Wi-Fi signal powered by grief**.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è But Wait ‚Äì There‚Äôs a Timed Quiz!

Yes. In the middle of this visual mayhem, I still managed to build a **timed quiz**.  
It works!  
Mostly.

It‚Äôs like a **confused pensioner crossing a motorway** ‚Äì slow, stubborn, but eventually gets to the other side.  

The JavaScript needs tweaking ‚Äì not just tweaks, really ‚Äì more like **therapy**.  
But I‚Äôll get there.  
**One callback function at a time.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Thoughts

So if you‚Äôre reading this, dear examiner, and wondering:

> ‚ÄúWhy is there no image? Why is the video not working? Why is the footer eating the chart?‚Äù

Please understand:

I **did try**.  
I **fought the code**. I **prayed**. I **wept**.  
At one point I started shouting at my screen like it owed me money.

But I‚Äôm still here.  
And the **quiz works**.  
And someday soon, when I recover and the **Guinness flows freely again**,  
I‚Äôll fix those images.  
I‚Äôll tame the JavaScript.  
And the footer?  
I‚Äôll **bury it with a shovel** in the **digital bog** it crawled out of.

Go easy on me. Or don‚Äôt.  
Either way ‚Äì **enjoy the quiz**, and **mind yourself**.

  ## üòÖ Final Thoughts

This site is built with:
- **Love**
- **Sarcasm**
- **Django**
- And a lot of **‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt this working!?‚Äù**

I‚Äôve cried. I‚Äôve screamed.  
I now **talk to Python like it‚Äôs a real person.**  
And after Project 3, I officially **lost my marbles**.

But it‚Äôs done. It works. It lives.

So read. Click. Laugh.  
Or just appreciate that **someone out there debugged for 9 hours just so you could take a Trump quiz in peace.**

---

**Mind yourself. Mind your code. And please, examiner... if you‚Äôve smiled even once... give us a pass, will ya?**
