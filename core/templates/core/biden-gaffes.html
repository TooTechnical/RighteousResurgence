                <h2>Sleepy Joe's Greatest Hits</h2>
                <p>Brace yourself for a highlight reel of legendary Biden gaffes. These aren’t made up — they’re straight from the teleprompter of destiny!</p>

                <ul class="gaffe-list">
                    <li>🗣️ “We choose truth over facts.”</li>
                    <li>🦵 “I got hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun.”</li>
                    <li>👨‍🏫 “Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.”</li>
                    <li>🇺🇸 “All men and women are created... by the... you know... the thing.”</li>
                    <li>🐎 “You’re a lying dog-faced pony soldier.”</li>
                    <li>🗳️ “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t Black.”</li>
                    <li>📍 Forgot which state he was in... more than once.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">We love democracy, and we also love a bit of comic relief. Thank you, Joe.</p>
